# Tarkov Scraper

Escape from Tarkov Wiki scraper for item data

Tested and working with Weapons, Weapon Mods, and Armor Vests

## Known Issues

- `/wiki/Ammunition` not yet supported due to nested ammunition types

- Armor penalties attributes are rendered as one long string due to the pages using breakpoints instead of unordered lists to display them
